    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Hello!! I'm Logan and uhh yeah, this is my website! <br>
        It's not much to look at right now, but I hope to keep working on it and turn it into something I'm proud of! :D</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>As mentioned before, my name is Logan <span class="pronouns">(he/him)</span> and I'm a student, a programmer, and an aspiring musician and animator. I only speak English, but I'm currently learning Japanese!<br>
    I'm currently taking CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course and I'm finding it super interesting and enjoyable. I like programming in general, especially making games, even though I rarely finish them.
    Offline, I enjoy going for walks in the bush and baking <i>(presuming I don't find a way to screw up the recipe...)</i>. I play the Piano and am learning the Clarinet.<br>
    That's about it!</p>
