    Hi! I should add some Easter Eggs, but when you can just look at the site's source code on GitHub, it makes them difficult to hide...
    Although... that could be viewed as a challenge.

    <p>Hello!! I'm Logan and uhh yeah, this is my website! <br>
        It's not much to look at right now, but I hope to keep working on it and turn it into something I'm proud of! :D</p>

<div>
    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>There isn't much to look at right now, just this and a <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page. In the future, I might add a blog, a portfolio, or something actually useful. Also Easter Eggs.</p>
</div>

<div id="about">
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Logan <span class="pronouns">(he/him)</span> and I'm a student, a programmer, and an aspiring musician and animator. I only speak English, but I'm currently learning Japanese!<br>
    I just finished CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course and I learnt a massive amount. I like programming in general, especially making <a href="/megatale/">games</a>, even though I rarely finish them.
    Offline, I enjoy going for walks in the bush and baking <i>(presuming I don't find a way to screw up the recipe...)</i>. I play the Piano (badly) and am learning the Clarinet.<br>
    That's about it!</p>
