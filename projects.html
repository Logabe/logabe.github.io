        <h2>Animation</h2>
        <p>
            In 2023, I decided to get back into animation after not doing a whole lot for 4 years. I was lucky enough
            to get mentoring and for the first time in ~4 years, finish an animation.

        <h2>Mini Libraries</h2>
        <p>When I completed CS50x, we had to submit a Final Project at the end of the course.
            For mine, I created <strong>Mini Libraries</strong>, a web app for managing small-scale 'sharing' libraries.
            This model is great for sharing books with friends and family, and I like it so much that I'm continuing
            development on the project.
            I've cleaned up a lot of the code, and I'm now working on adding features to the app.</p>

        <h2>The Ever-Expanding Spreadsheet</h2>
        <p>
            I have a habit of not finishing projects, so I made this spreadsheet to keep track of everything.<br>
            As I finish or abandon these projects I'll move them to their respective tabs to free up space for new ones.
